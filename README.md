I've been learning Web Development since I got out of college just for fun and I'm still doing it today! 

I'm focusing on frontend development and React is my jam right now and I'm learning Typescript and Next.js for a more leveled up apps I'll be making.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- âš¡ Fun fact: Like fingerprints, everyone's tongue print is different.
